960789012,712345678,NEED_INFO,"Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930 KS) is a South Korean company paying dividends to a Norwegian investor (NBIM) on ex-date 2025-03-31. NBIM calculated 25% total tax (22% withholding + 3% local tax) on 9,025,000 KRW gross dividend, resulting in 2,255,050 KRW total tax and 6,769,950 KRW net. The custodian applied only 20% total tax, resulting in 1,805,000 KRW tax and 7,220,000 KRW net. From the available research: South Korea imposes 22% standard withholding tax on dividends to non-residents (including 10% local income tax on the withholding liability), which aligns with both calculations when considering the base rates. However, I could not locate the specific bilateral tax treaty between Korea and Norway or its applicable dividend withholding rates in the search results. While I found Norway's general treaty framework and Korea's treaty structure, the specific Korea-Norway treaty rates that would determine the correct tax treatment for this Samsung Electronics dividend were not available from reliable official sources. Without access to the actual Korea-Norway bilateral tax treaty provisions and their specific dividend withholding rates, it is not possible to definitively determine whether NBIM's 25% rate or the custodian's 20% rate is correct.",342.77000000000044,USD,2025-03-31,2
970456789,823456791,NBIM_WRONG,"Shares position break analysis for Nestle SA (NESN SW) with ex-date 2025-04-25: NBIM expected dividends on 10,000 shares but custodian calculated dividends on 12,000 shares. NBIM's position data shows the actual position on 2025-04-25 was 12,000 shares, confirming custodian's calculation. Settlement movements reveal a 2,000 share BUY trade settled on 2025-04-25, explaining the difference between NBIM's expected 10,000 shares and the actual 12,000 shares. The custodian correctly calculated dividends on the actual settled position of 12,000 shares (resulting in 24,180 CHF), while NBIM's expectation of 10,000 shares (resulting in 20,150 CHF) was outdated and did not account for the settled trade that increased the position.",4030.0,CHF,2025-04-25,1
