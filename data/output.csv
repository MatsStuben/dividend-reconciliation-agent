960789012,712345678,NEED_INFO,"For Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930 KS) dividend ex-date 2025-03-31, there is a tax rate mismatch where NBIM expects 25% total tax rate while custodian reports 20% total tax rate. This creates different tax amounts - NBIM calculates 2,255,050 KRW total tax (including 1,985,500 KRW withholding tax at 22% and 269,550 KRW local tax) while custodian reports 1,805,000 KRW total tax. From the research conducted, South Korea's standard withholding tax rate for dividends paid to non-residents is 22% (including local income tax of 10% on the withholding tax liability), as confirmed by multiple sources including PWC and Santander Trade. However, I was unable to locate specific information about the Korea-Norway tax treaty or any reduced withholding tax rates that may apply specifically to Norwegian investors. The search results show extensive information about withholding tax rates for other countries but no clear documentation of the bilateral tax treaty between South Korea and Norway that would govern dividend payments to Norwegian entities like NBIM. Without access to the specific treaty provisions and applicable rates between Korea and Norway, it is not possible to determine definitively whether the 20% or 25% rate is correct for this Norwegian investor.",342.77000000000044,USD
970456789,823456791,CUSTODY_WRONG,"For Nestle SA (NESN SW) ex-date 2025-04-25, there is a shares position break where NBIM expected 10,000 shares but custody reported 12,000 shares. NBIM's internal position records show 12,000 shares on 2025-04-25, indicating NBIM's internal systems and custody agree on the actual holding quantity. However, trade settlement data reveals a 2,000 share BUY trade that settled on 2025-04-25 (the ex-date). Since trades settling on the ex-date typically do not qualify for dividend entitlement (as entitlement is determined at market close on the day before ex-date), the correct dividend entitlement should be calculated on 10,000 shares (12,000 total holding minus 2,000 shares from the same-day settlement). Therefore, NBIM's expected dividend calculation basis of 10,000 shares is correct, while custody's use of the full 12,000 share holding for dividend calculation is incorrect.",4030.0,CHF
