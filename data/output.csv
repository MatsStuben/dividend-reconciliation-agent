960789012,712345678,NEED_INFO,"The tax discrepancy concerns Samsung Electronics Co Ltd dividends with ex-date 2025-03-31, where NBIM applies a 25% total tax rate while the custodian applies 20%. NBIM shows withholding tax of 1,985,500 KRW (22% rate) plus local tax of 269,550 KRW on gross amount of 9,025,000 KRW, while the custodian applies a 20% total rate resulting in tax of 1,805,000 KRW. Research confirms South Korea's standard non-resident dividend withholding tax rate is 22% including local income tax (20% base rate plus 10% local surcharge on the withholding liability, effectively 2% additional). However, tax treaties can reduce these rates. While Norway's government website lists treaty withholding rates for dividends from Norway, no specific information was found regarding the Korea-Norway tax treaty rate for dividends flowing from Korea to Norway. The research confirms that treaty rates may apply but the specific Korea-Norway treaty dividend rate could not be verified from authoritative sources within the search limitations. Given the lack of definitive information about the applicable treaty rate between Korea and Norway for this dividend payment, there is insufficient reliable data to determine which calculation is correct.",342.77000000000044,USD
970456789,823456791,NBIM_WRONG,"For Nestle SA (NESN SW) with ex-date 2025-04-25, NBIM calculated dividends based on 10,000 shares while custodian shows 12,000 shares (difference of 2,000 shares). The position query confirms NBIM held 12,000 shares on the ex-date. The settlement movements reveal a buy trade of 2,000 shares that settled on the ex-date (2025-04-25). This buy trade increased NBIM's position from 10,000 to 12,000 shares by the ex-date, making NBIM entitled to dividends on the full 12,000 shares. NBIM's internal calculation failed to account for this settled buy trade, using the outdated 10,000 share position instead of the correct 12,000 shares for dividend entitlement.",4030.0,CHF
