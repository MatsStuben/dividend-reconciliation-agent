970456789,823456791,NBIM_WRONG,"For Nestle SA (NESN SW) dividend event with ex-date 2025-04-25, there is a shares position break where custodian holds 12,000 shares vs NBIM's expected 10,000 shares. The position lookup confirms NBIM's actual holding is 12,000 shares, matching the custodian's booked position. Additionally, settlement movements show a 2,000 share BUY trade on the ex-date that has already SETTLED. This explains why NBIM's expected position of 10,000 shares is incorrect - it did not account for the settled purchase of 2,000 additional shares that occurred on the ex-date. The correct dividend entitlement should be based on 12,000 shares, making NBIM's expected position wrong.",4030.0,CHF
