960789012,712345678,NEED_INFO,"NBIM calculated a total tax of 2,255,050 KRW (25% effective rate) while the custodian calculated 1,805,000 KRW (20% effective rate) on Samsung Electronics Co Ltd dividend from South Korea to Norway. The search results show that South Korea's standard withholding tax rate on dividends for non-residents is 22% (including local tax), which may be reduced under applicable tax treaties. However, none of the three web searches conducted provided specific information about the exact withholding tax rate applicable under the South Korea-Norway tax treaty for dividends. The searches confirmed that South Korea has tax treaties with many countries including Norway, and that reduced rates may apply, but the specific treaty rate for dividends between South Korea and Norway could not be determined from the available sources. Without knowing the specific treaty withholding tax rate applicable to dividends from South Korea to Norway, and without clarity on how local taxes are calculated in addition to withholding tax, there is insufficient information to determine whether NBIM's 25% calculation or the custodian's 20% calculation is correct.",342.77000000000044,USD
970456789,823456791,CUSTODY_WRONG,"For Nestle SA (NESN SW) with ex-date 2025-04-25, the custody position shows 12,000 shares while NBIM's nominal basis is 10,000 shares. NBIM's actual position on the ex-date was confirmed at 12,000 shares. Settlement movements show a buy trade of 2,000 shares on 2025-04-25 that was settled, explaining the increase from 10,000 to 12,000 shares. However, the custody is reporting a nominal basis of 10,000 shares (matching NBIM) while simultaneously booking 12,000 shares as the holding quantity. This inconsistency in custody's own reporting - where their nominal basis doesn't reflect their booked position despite the settled trade - indicates the custody's booked position calculation is incorrect.",4030.0,CHF
